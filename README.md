# Global Weather App

Welcome to the Global Weather App! This application provides weather information for locations around the world. It's built using React and Vite, and it fetches data from a weather API.
Usage
Search for a City:
Enter the name of a city in the search bar to get the current weather information.

View Weather Details:
The app will display the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for the searched city.

API

This project uses the visual-crossing-weather.p.rapidapi.com to fetch weather data. You will need an API key to use this service. Sign up on their website to obtain an API key.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
